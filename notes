What’s the issue?
During the release weekend of version 1.99, a dot release (1.99.8) was scheduled for deployment on Friday evening. However, due to a configuration issue in the Jules pipeline, version 1.99 started deploying instead of the intended 1.98.3. The SRE team identified the issue and stopped the deployment within 15 minutes.

Cause of the issue?

The Jules pipeline manifest had incorrect release folder details for version 1.98.3, which led to version 1.99 being deployed instead.
The validation process for the UAT deployment didn’t catch this misconfiguration. Monitoring UAT deployment logs or reviewing the databasechangelog table could have revealed the issue early.
ECB approval was granted based on evidence that didn’t fully account for the need to validate UAT deployment and check for potential misconfigurations.
Steps done for mitigation?

The SRE team quickly halted the deployment after discovering the issue, limiting the impact of the misconfiguration.
SRE worked with L1 to bring down all affected services, including the CORE application, to prevent further execution of incorrect scripts.
The CORE team rescheduled and reran a critical user job to ensure no user-related reconciliation breaks occurred, maintaining data integrity.
Lesson learnt?

Configuration management in deployment pipelines is a critical step and should be verified across all environments before releases.
UAT deployment logs and database change logs (such as the databasechangelog table) should be actively monitored and reviewed during the validation process.
Approval processes (like ECB) need to ensure all validations and testing are fully completed and checked before being finalized.
Action items?

Implement improved configuration checks in the pipeline to avoid misconfigurations in future releases.
Enhance UAT validation practices by introducing mandatory log monitoring and database validation.
Refine the release approval process to ensure thorough validation steps are taken before sign-off.
